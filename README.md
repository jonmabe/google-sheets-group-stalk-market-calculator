A Google App Script to manage Animal Crossing New Horizon's Stalk Market predictions -- with a group!

## Getting Started

Open and create your own copy of this Google Sheet.

If you have a friend group, you can invite them all as editors, then have everyone add their names to the "manifest" tab. New tracking sheets will be created for everyone on the manifest tab.

## Editing the Script

1. Open `Tools` / `Script Editor`
2. Select `Run` / `Run Function` / `priceTest`
3. An in-window popup will ask you for permissions. Select `Review Permissions`
4. Another popup will ask which Google Account you want to link this script to. `Continue`.
5. A very menacing page will explain that this script isn't verified through Google. To continue, click the tiny text `Advanced` near the bottom, then click `Go to Stalks (unsafe)`
6. Finally, select `Allow`
